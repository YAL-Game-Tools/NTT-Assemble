# NTT-Assemble #
This is the source code for a piece of software that handles executable reassembly for [Nuclear Throne Together](https://yellowafterlife.itch.io/nuclear-throne-together). 

In short, the way it works by combining pieces from the original game with those that mod needs to change and into a new executable file.

Written in C++ to have fewer dependencies.
